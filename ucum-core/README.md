## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
octofhir-ucum-core = "0.2.0"
```

## Basic Usage

The core library provides functions for parsing, evaluating, and converting UCUM expressions. For detailed code examples, please refer to the [UCUM-RS User Guide](https://github.com/octofhir/ucum-rs/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md).

### Parsing Expressions

Use `parse_expression` to parse a UCUM expression into an abstract syntax tree (AST). This function takes a string representation of a UCUM expression and returns a `Result<UnitExpr, String>`.

### Evaluating Expressions

Use `evaluate` to evaluate a parsed expression and determine its canonical form, conversion factor, and dimensions. This function takes a reference to a `UnitExpr` and returns a `Result<EvaluationResult, String>`.

### Looking Up Units

Use `find_unit` to look up a unit by its code. This function takes a string code and returns an `Option<&Unit>`.

### Converting Between Units

To convert a value from one unit to another, you need to:
1. Parse both unit expressions
2. Evaluate both expressions
3. Check if the units have the same dimensions
4. Apply the conversion factor

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Complex Expressions

The library can handle complex unit expressions, including:
- Power units (e.g., "kg.m2/s3")
- Concentration units (e.g., "mmol/L")
- Count per volume (e.g., "10*3/L")
- Annotated units (e.g., "mm[Hg]")

### Temperature Conversions

Temperature units require special handling due to their offsets:
- Celsius ("Cel")
- Fahrenheit ("[degF]")
- Kelvin ("K")

When converting between temperature units, you need to handle the offsets:
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: ¬∞F = ¬∞C √ó 9/5 + 32
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: ¬∞C = (¬∞F - 32) √ó 5/9
- Celsius to Kelvin: K = ¬∞C + 273.15
- Kelvin to Celsius: ¬∞C = K - 273.15

### Working with Arbitrary Units

Arbitrary units are units that are not defined in terms of any other unit:
- International Unit ("[IU]")
- Arbitrary Unit ("[arb'U]")
- United States Pharmacopeia Unit ("[USP'U]")

Arbitrary units:
- Are enclosed in square brackets
- Have a factor of 1.0
- Are dimensionless
- Cannot be converted to non-arbitrary units
- Can be prefixed (e.g., "k[IU]")
- Can be combined with other units (e.g., "[IU]/mL")

### Error Handling

The library provides comprehensive error handling for:
- Parse errors (invalid syntax or unrecognized unit)
- Evaluation errors (error evaluating the expression)
- Incommensurable units (units with different dimensions)

### Data Structures

#### `UnitExpr`

Represents a parsed UCUM expression.

```
pub enum UnitExpr {
    Simple(String),
    Annotated(String, String),
    Prefixed(String, Box<UnitExpr>),
    Power(Box<UnitExpr>, i32),

The seven components represent:
1. Mass (M)
2. Length (L)
3. Time (T)
4. Electric current (I)
5. Temperature (Œò)
6. Amount of substance (N)
7. Luminous intensity (J)

## Extending the Library

### Adding Custom Units

To add a custom unit, you need to define:
- A unique code
- A canonical form
- Conversion factors to base units
- Dimensional information

The library provides a registry system for adding custom units. See the [UCUM-RS User Guide](https://github.com/octofhir/ucum-rs/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed examples of how to extend the library with custom units.
