# UCUM Specification

_The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ is a code system intended to include _all_ units of measures being contemporarily used in international science, engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans. A typical application of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ are electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication.

_The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ is inspired by and heavily based on ISO 2955-1983, ANSI X3.50-1986, and HL7's extensions called "ISO+". The respective ISO and ANSI standards are both entitled "Representation of \[...\] units in systems with limited character sets" where ISO 2955 refers to SI and other units provided by ISO 1000-1981, while ANSI X3.50 extends ISO 2955 to include U.S. customary units. Because these standards carry the restriction of "limited character sets" in their names they seem to be of less value today, when graphical user interfaces and laser printers are in wide-spread use. For this reason, the European standard ENV 12435 in its clause 7.3 declares ISO 2955 obsolete.

ENV 12435 is dedicated exclusively to the communication of measurements between humans in display and print, and does not provide codes that can be used in communication between systems. It does not even provide a specification that would allow communication of units from one system to the screen or printer of another system. The issue about displaying units in the common style defined by the 9th _Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures_ (CGPM) in 1947 is not just the character set. Although the _Unicode_ standard and its predecessor ISO/IEC 10646 is the richest character set ever, it is still not enough to specify the presentation of units, because there are important typographical details such as superscripts, subscripts, roman and italics.[1](#fn1)

The real value of the restriction on the character set and typographical details, however, is not to cope with legacy systems and less powerful technology, but to facilitate unambiguous communication and interpretation of the meaning of units from one computer system to another. In this respect, ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 are not obsolete because there is no other standard that would fill in for inter-systems communication of units. However, ISO 2599 and ANSI X3.50 currently have severe defects:

1.  ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 contain numerous name conflicts, both direct conflicts (e.g., "`a`" being used for both "year" and "are") and conflicts that are generated through combination of unit symbols with prefixes (e.g., "`cd`" means candela and centi-day and "`PEV`" means peta-volt and pico-electronvolt.)
  
  
4.  Neither ISO 2955 nor ANSI X3.50 cover all units that are currently used in practice. There are many more units in use than what is allowed by the _Système International d'Unités_ (SI) and accompanying standards. For example, the older CGM-units dyne and erg are still used in the science of physiology. Although ANSI X3.50 extends ISO 2955 with some U.S. customary units, it is still not complete in this respect. For example it does not define the degree Fahrenheit.
  
  
7.  ANSI X3.50 is semantically ambiguous with respect to customary units, even if we do not consider the history and international aspects of customary units. Three systems of mass units are used in the U.S., avoirdupois used generally, apothecaries' used by pharmacists, and troy used in trade with Gold and other precious metals. ANSI X3.50 has no way to select any one of those specifically, which is bad in medicine, where both apothecaries' and avoirdupois weights are being used frequently.
  
  

ISO 2955 and all standards that do only look for the resolutions and recommendations of the CGPM and the _Comité International des Poids et Mesures_ (CIPM) as published by the _Bureau International des Poids et Mesures_ (BIPM) and various ISO standards (ISO 1000 and ISO 31) fail to recognize that the needs in practice are often different from the ideal propositions of the CGPM. Although not allowed by the CGPM and related ISO standards, many other units are used in international sciences, healthcare, engineering, and business, both meaningfully and some units of questionable meaning. A coding system that is to be useful in practice must cover the requirements and habits of the practice—even some of the bad habits.

None of the current standards attempt to specify a semantics of units that can be deployed in information systems with moderate requirements. Metrological standards such as those published by the BIPM are dedicated to maximal scientific correctness of reproducible definitions of units. These definitions make sense only to human specialists and can hardly be deployed to their full extent by any information system that is not dedicated to metrology. On the other hand, ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 provide no semantics at all for the codes they define.

_The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ provides a single coding system for units that is complete, free of all ambiguities, and that assigns to each defined unit a concise semantics. In communication it is not only important that all communicating parties have the same repertoire of symbols, but also that all attach the same meaning to the symbols they exchange. The common meaning must be computationally verifiable. _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ assumes a semantics for units based on dimensional analysis.[2](#fn2)

In short, each unit is defined relative to a system of base units by a numeric factor and a vector of exponents by which the base units contribute to the unit to be defined. Although we can reflect all the meaning of units covered by dimensional analysis with this vector notation, the following tables do not show these vectors. One reason is that the vectors depend on the base system chosen and even on the ordering of the base units. The other reason is that these vectors are hard to understand to human readers while they can be easily derived computationally. Therefore we define new unit symbols using algebraic terms of other units. Those algebraic terms are also valid codes of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_.
