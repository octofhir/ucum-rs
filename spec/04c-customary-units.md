### 4.4 Customary Unit Atoms

Customary units have once been used all over Europe. Units were taken from nature: anatomical structures (e.g., arm, foot, finger), botanical objects (e.g., grains of various sorts, rod), or processes of everyday life (e.g., amount of land one could plow in a morning, the length of 1000 steps, an hour of walking, etc.).

Many of these units can be traced back in history to the Romans (mile), Greeks (carat) and even more ancient times. It is thus no wonder that this heritage was in some way ordered. Indeed, one finds the same names for units used in different countries and most of these units where divided into smaller or multiplied to larger units in the same way.

For example, there was the foot (de. "Fuß" fr. "pied" nl. "voet") that was divided into 12 inches (de. "Zoll" fr. "pouce"). An inch was divided into 12 lines (de. "Linie" fr. "ligne" ). Two feet was one ell (de. "Elle" da. "Alen" sv. "Aln"). The ell was, however, not very popular in England, as opposed to the rest of Europe. Conversely, the yard is hard to find elsewhere, aside from the Argentinian "vara." But it is perhaps no accident that the meter ended up as the 40 × 10-6 of an earth's meridian, which is approximately one yard (43.7 × 10-6). The rod (de. "Rute" fr. "perche" nl. "roede" sv. "stång") was very popular all over Europe and so was the fathom (de. "Klafter").

The square rod (de. "Quadratrute" fr. "perche-carrée" nl. "vierkante-roede" was mainly used to measure land. The acre as the legendary land to sow in one morning (or day) is also widespread (de. "Morgen, Tagwerk, Acker" fr. "arpent" sv. "tunnland" , although the exact amount in square rod varies considerably from region to region. Interestingly, even the special purpose measures such as the "hand" for measuring horses have international equivalents (de. "faust").

One can indeed say that there was once a "_système international d'unités coutumières_" but the magnitudes of the units were not standardized internationally. Of course, Great Britain had the most impact in standardizing the customary system, because of its colonies, including its most important colony, America. However, after the customary units were established in the U.S. a major reform took place through the British Weights and Measures Act of 1824. For instance, Queen Anne's wine Gallon of 231 cubic inches, still used in the U.S., was discarded then, and the older bushel was standardized differently in Great Britain. Other deviations between the English and U.S. measures are due to various alignments with the metric system. Thus, in the U.S., the yard was standardized as 3600/3937 m and the inch was 2.540005 cm while in England the inch was still 2.539998 cm.

In 1959 major parts of the U.S. and British system of customary units were standardized internationally, again aligned to the metric system which is why the international yard is 0.9144 m exactly and the nautical mile became 1852 m exactly. However, traditional subdivisions and multiples have not been abolished in favor of the international standard. Furthermore the old U.S. standard for the yard is still legally used for land surveying.

Conclusively, there are different systems of customary units that are in use today. These systems use the same names for units that have different equivalents in the metric system, because the customary systems are based on different reference quantities but multiples and subdivisions of the reference quantities are very similar, though with notable exceptions.

In the following tables we tried to give the original definitions to the customary units. This means in general that the references to the metric system are as few as possible, with most of the units of one system defined as multiples and subdivisions of one reference unit.

We use the subscript notation to disambiguate units with same names in the different systems. Subscript notation means, for instance that if the print symbol for foot is "ft" we use subscripts to distinguish the international foot "fti" the U.S. survey foot "ftus" and the British Imperial foot "ftbr" We do not actually list print symbols for customary units, because there seems to be no standard for it, and because defining print symbols is out of scope of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_. However, we presume that subscripts be used to disambiguate whatever print symbols are being used. According to [§§13ff](#para-13), _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ uses the underscore to denote those subscripts, and also encloses the entire unit atom into square brackets. Hence, the symbols for the international foot, the U.S. survey foot and the British Imperial foot are defined as "`[ft_i]`," "`[ft_us]`," and "`[ft_br]`" respectively.

Prospective users of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ may be disappointed by the fact that there are many different symbols for foot and inch defined but all of them have a subscript and thus none of them are equal to the ANSI X3.50 symbols. We considered to define default symbols for customary units, where, e.g., the common units of length (foot, inch) would default to the international customary units, while mass units (pound, ounce) would default to the avoirdupois system. However, because the customary system is quite complex, and units by the same names can differ by more than 20%, defining defaults will probably cause even more confusion. There is no denial: a gallon is not just a gallon and a pound is not just a pound, this is the disadvantage of dealing with a unit system of medieval origin.

In general the international customary units are effective in the U.S. and in Great Britain since 1959. We are unsure, however, about this in countries that formerly or at present belong to the Commonwealth. We therefore appreciate advice and reference to original sources on this transition. Conceivably other countries may have made exceptions in the transition to the international definitions of customary units, such as the U.S. where the old definitions have been retained for the purpose of land surveying.

It is not quite clear exactly what units the international customary system comprises. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica \[_British Imperial System. Britannica Online_\], the rod was removed in Great Britain in 1963. Since the definition of the acre is based on the rod, we did not include rod and acre in the international customary system. In the U.S. the acre is still defined on the older U.S. customary system as of 1893.

In general, we did not include special customary units of area and volume in [Table 8](#intcust), since these are still used differently in the U.S. Special symbols such as square inch and cubic foot have been included according to ANSI X3.50. Generally the "square-" and "cubic-" prefixes are unnecessary in ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 and are deprecated by _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_. We placed the board foot, cord and circular mil into the international table because these units are suggested by ANSI X3.50 but we were not sure in what sense they are still used. We did, however, not include the square mile in the international table because in the U.S. measurements in square miles are most likely based on the survey mile that is part of the older system, see [§35](#para-35).

The circular mil is exactly the area of a circle with a diameter of one mil. One mil, in turn, equals 1/1000 inch ("mil" is the etymological equivalent of "milli-inch" ) The mil has been defined in [Table 8](#intcust) to support the exact definition of the circular mil.

ANSI X3.50 does not define a symbol for the "hand," but this unit is mentioned in the table given by the Encyclopedia Britannica. The hand is used in measuring the height of horses from foot to shoulder. It was probably not subject to the internationalization of customary units. Any advice as whether the hand is used based on an older British or U.S. definition is appreciated.

After the 1959 international agreement changed the definition of the yard in the US to be 0.9144 m exactly, surveyors and civil engineers complained that voluminous legacy surveys and so forth used the previous definition of (1200/3937) m and that this change would be disruptive. So, by statute, Congress created a survey foot of (1200/3937) m (the old 1893 Mendenhall Order definition). Thus, by statute, miles used in surveying are referred to as statute miles of 5280 survey feet each. The fathom, rod, and furlong are likewise based on the survey foot.

According to NIST, the acre as normally used in the U.S. is defined in terms of U.S. survey lengths, and not in terms of the international customary system. This older U.S. customary system of survey lengths is still used for geodesic measurements.

The older British Imperial system is predominantly of historical interest. However, it may be that some former members of the Commonwealth have retained this system after 1959, when the unified international definitions where established, and after 1963, when the British system was revised in England.

The chain was proposed by Edmund Gunter in England of the 17th century. It is possible that Gunter's chain and Ramden's chain are related to other European traditional units such as the English "rope" (measuring 20 feet) or the old German "Landseil" (measuring 52 ells or 104 feet) named after ropes or chains that could be spanned in order to measure land. The difference in the definitions of those units is no surprise as there is nothing that restricts a chain or rope to a particular length. However, these units are still similar in magnitude.

**§37 U.S. volumes** {#para-37}

The U.S. fluid volumes have been defined based on Queen Anne's wine gallon which was in turn defined exactly as 231 cubic inch. Although we used international inch, we are not sure what inch definition is actually used for defining the exact size of a U.S. gallon. However, the differences between the various inches are minimal, even when raised to the 3rd power (i.e., the difference between the U.S. inch and the British Imperial inch remains in the sixth decimal digit.)

Dry measures are based on the bushel (corn bushel), originally defined in 1701 as "any round measure with a plain and even bottom, being 18.5 inches wide throughout and 8 inches deep." This definition, being (18.5/2)2 π × 8 = 2150.42017138221... cubic inch was later truncated to 2150.42 cubic inch exactly. At times the bushel was closely related with the Winchester gallon (corn gallon), which has been mentioned as an historical curiosity.

ANSI X3.50 defines symbols for the units cup, tablespoon and teaspoon which are predominantly used in cooking recipes but also in practical medicine. Similar units can often be found in European cook books, but are usually translated into metric units outside the U.S. For practical medicine these are still very handy units to give instructions to patients.

**§38 British Imperial volumes** {#para-38} 

* 1. British Imperial volumes according to the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 are defined in [Table 12](#brit-volumes).  
* 2. The meaning of the columns is declared in [§34](#para-34).

The British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 removed the medieval distinction between wine and grain measures and defined one unified system of volumes based on a new Gallon that was defined similarly as the metric unit liter: "10 imperial pounds weight of distilled water weighed in air against brass weights with the water and the air at a temperature of 62 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer and with the barometer at 30 inches."

With the current definition of the gallon as 277.421 cubic inches (approximately) and a density of water of 0.99878 kg/l according to NIST data, the inch must have been approximately 2.5371 cm at that time. Because of this difficulty with the original definition of the British gallon we based the British Imperial volumes on the gallon for which there is an exact metric equivalence, according to NIST, which provides usually well researched data.

Note that the subdivisions of the British Imperial system of volumes differs from the U.S. system of fluid volumes between gill and fluid ounce: in the British system 1 oz fl equals 1/5 gill where in the U.S. system 1 oz fl equals 1/4 gill. Thus, although the British system starts out with a 20% larger gallon, the British fluid ounce, fluid dram and minim are 4% smaller than the U.S. units with the same name.

**§39 avoirdupois weights** {#para-39} 

* 1. The avoirdupois system of mass units is defined in [Table 13](#avoirdupois).  
* 2. The meaning of the columns is declared in [§34](#para-34).

The avoirdupois system is used in the U.S. as well as in countries that use the British Imperial system. Avoirdupois is the default system of mass units used for all goods that "have weight" (fr. _avoir du poids_). Interestingly all three systems of weight are based on the same grain of barley, standardized to 64.79891 mg exactly \[NIST\].

**§40 troy weights** {#para-40} 

* 1. The troy system of mass units is defined in [Table 14](#troy).  
* 2. The meaning of the columns is declared in [§34](#para-34).

The troy system originates in Troyes, a City in the Champagne (France) that hosted a major European fair. The troy system was later used for measuring precious metals. The World Monetary Fund valued all currencies against the troy ounce of gold at least until the 1960s (advice appreciated). The troy ounce is still used in worldwide trade with gold, even in countries that otherwise use metric units (de. "feinunze"). The troy system retains the original Roman subdivision of the pound in 12 ounces. The Roman _uncia_ was "one twelfth" of a _libra_ (hence the symbol "lb" for the pound), just as the inch (also originating from la. "libra" is one twelfth of a foot. The subdivision of 12 ounces/inches per pound/foot and 2 foot per ell (la. "cubit" apparently originated in the ancient Egypt and was carried on by the Greeks and Romans into the medieval Europe. However, there was always an ambiguity such that the subdivision of 1/12 could become 1/16 and vice versa, hence the avoirdupois ounce of 1/16 pound.

Note also that the troy pound was abolished in England on January 6, 1879 \[Jacques J. Proot, _Anglo-Saxon weights & measures_, URL: `http://members.aol.com/JackProot/met/spvolas.html`\].

Note that some U.S. pharmacies still use this system of apothecaries' weights when measuring the amount of drugs. This system is very different from the avoirdupois system though based on the same grain. The apothecaries' dram is more than twice as much as the avoirdupois dram, the ounce is still 10% greater than the avoirdupois ounce while the pound is 20% less than the avoirdupois pound. The apothecaries' system, just as the troy system, keeps the original Roman subdivision of an ounce (la. "uncia" to be 1/12 pound (la. "libra"). Hence is the apothecaries' pound about 22% smaller than the avoirdupois pound, while its subdivisions are greater than the respective avoirdupois subdivisions (ounce 10%, dram 119%). This difference in the weight systems is the most important reason why ANSI X3.50 should not be applied in medicine, where both systems are being used and therefore misinterpretations are inevitable.

There are three systems of typesetter's lengths in use today: Françcois-Ambroise Didot (1730-1804), a publisher in Paris, invented this system based on the traditional subdivisions of the customary units: 1 line was 1/12 inch and 1/6 line was one point. Henceforth the size of letters were measured in point. However, the Didot system is based on the _pouce_, i.e. the french inch, which, just as the English inch, is 1/12 _pied_ (foot). But the French foot was about 6.5% greater than the British Imperial foot. In the Anglo-American realm the typesetter's point was based on the British Imperial inch, with the same subdivisions. However, in the type foundries' industry the original definition of a point drifted apart, and in the late 19th century U.S. type foundries reestablished a slightly (0.375%) greater standard point. This point made its way back to the British. However, recently, the computer typesetting industry readjusted the point to its original size of 1/72 inch. All three systems, however, are still being used today.
