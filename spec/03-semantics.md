### 3 Semantics

**§16 preliminaries** {#para-16}

1. The semantics of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ is defined by the algebraic operations of multiplication, division and exponentiation between units, by the equivalence relations of equality and commensurability of units, and by the multiplication of a unit with a scalar. 
2. Every expression in _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ is mapped to one and only one semantic element. But every semantic element may have more than one valid representant in _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_. 
3. The set of expressions in _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ is infinite.

**§17 equality and commensurability** {#para-17}

1. The set of expressions in _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ has two binary, symmetric, reflexive, and transitive relations (equivalence relations) "equals" = and "is commensurable with" ~. All expressions that are equal are also commensurable but not all commensurable expressions are equal.

**§18 algebra of units** {#para-18}

1. The equivalence classes generated by the equality relation = are called _units_. 
2. The set of units _U_ has a binary multiplication operator · that is associative and commutative and has the neutral element **1** (so called _the unity_). For each unit **u** ∈ _U_ there is an inverse unit **u**-1 such that **u** · **u**-1 = **1**. Thus, (_U_, ·) is an Abelian group. 
3. The division operation **u** / **v** is defined as **u** · **v**-1. 
4. The exponentiation operation with integer exponents _n_ is defined as **u**_n_ = **Π**1n**u**. 
5. The product **u**' = _r_**u** of a real number scalar with the unit **u** is also a unit, where **u**' ~ **u**.

**§19 dimension and magnitude** {#para-19}

1. The equivalence classes generated by the commensurability relation ~ are called _dimensions_. The set _D_ of dimensions is infinite in principle, but only a finite subset of dimensions are used in practice. Thus, implementations of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ need not be able to represent the infinite set of dimensions. 
2. Two commensurable units that are not equal differ only by their magnitude. 

**§20 base units** {#para-20}

1. Any system of units is constructed from a finite set **B** of mutually independent base units **B** = { **b**1, **b**2, ..., **b**_n_ }, on which any other unit **u** ∈ _U_ is defined as **u** = _r_1**b**1_u_1 · _r_2**b**2_u_2 · ... · _r__n_**b**_n__u__n_, where _r_ = _r_1 · _r_2 ·· · _r__n_ is called the _magnitude_ of the unit **u** regarding **B**. 
2. With respect to a basis **B** every unit can thus be represented as a pair (_r_, _û_) of magnitude _r_ and dimension _û_ = (_u_1, _u_2, ..., _u__n_). 
3. Two sets of base units are equivalent if there is an isomorphism between the sets of units that they generate.

[§19](#para-19).1 allows to limit the set of supported dimensions. Most practically used units contain exponents of -4 to +4. Thus if memory is limited, 4 bit per component of the dimension vector could be sufficient.

### 3.1 Special Units on non-ratio Scales

**§21 special units** {#para-21}

1. Those symbols that are used as units that imply a measurement on a scale other than a ratio scale (e.g., interval scale, logarithmic scale) are defined differently. These do not represent proper units as elements of the group (_U_,·). Therefore those special semantic entities are called _special units_, as opposed to _proper units_. The set of special units is denoted _S_, where _S_ ∩ _U_ = {}. 
2. A special unit **s** ∈ _S_ is defined as the triple (**u**, _f_**s**, _f_**s**-1) where **u** ∈ _U_ is the "corresponding" proper unit of **s** and where _f_**s** and _f_**s**-1 are mutually inverse real functions converting the measurement value to and from the special unit. 
3. Although not elements of _U_, special units are said to be "of the same dimension" or "commensurable with" their corresponding proper unit **u** and the class of units commensurable with **u**. This can be expressed by means of a binary, symmetric, transitive and reflexive relation ≈ on _U_ ∪ _S_.

The functions _f_**s** and _f_**s**-1 are applied as follows: let _r_**s** be the numeric measurement value expressed in the special unit **s** and let _m_ be the corresponding dimensioned quantity, i.e., the measurement with proper unit **u**. Now, _r_**s** = _f_**s**(_m_/**u**) converts the proper measurement to the special unit and _m_ = _f_**s**-1(_r_**s**) × **u** does the inverse.

**§22 operations on special units** {#para-22}

1. In theory, special units cannot take part in any algebraic operations, neither involving other units, nor themselves (exponentiation) nor involving scalars. 
2. Special units are therefore non-metric units. 
3. However, due to the requirement of the SI that does allow prefixes on the degree Celsius, special units may be _scaled_ trough a prefix or an arbitrary numeric factor. 
4. The scale factor _α_ is an additional component of the special unit, which in turn is defined by a quadruple **s** = (**u**, _f_**s**, _f_**s**-1, _α_). When the functions _f_**s** and _f_**s**-1 are applied to a measurement value _x_ to convert to and from the special unit the scale factor is applied as follows: _x_' = _f_**s**(_x_) / _α_ converts from _x_ expressed in the corresponding proper unit to _x_' in terms of the special unit and _x_ = _f_**s**-1(_α__x

Since prefixes have a scalar value that multiplies the unit atom, a unit must at least have a defined multiplication operation with a scalar in order to be a candidate for the metric predicate. All proper units are candidates for the metric property, special units are no such candidates.

The _Comité Consultatif d'Unités_ (CCU) decided in February 1995 that any SI prefix may be used with degree Celsius. This statement has not been made explicitly before. This is an unfortunate decision because difference-scale units like the degree Celsius have no multiplication operation, so that the prefix value could be multiplied with the unit. Instead the prefix at non-ratio units scales the measurement value. One wonders why the CGPM keeps the Celsius temperature in the SI as it is superfluous and in a unique way incoherent with the SI.

The scale factor _α_ is applied with the functions _f_**s** and _f_**s**-1 as follows: let _r_**s** be the numeric measurement value expressed in the special unit **s** and let _m_ be the corresponding dimensioned quantity, i.e., the measurement with proper unit **u**. Now, _r_**s** = _f_**s**(_m_/**u**) / _α_ converts the proper measurement to the special unit and _m_ = _f_**s**-1(_α__r_**s**) × **u** does the reverse.

**§23 definition of special units** {#para-23}

1. Special units are marked in the definition tables for unit atoms by a bullet ('•') in the column titled "value" and a special expression in the column titled "definition". The BNF for the special expression is <_special-unit_\> ::= <_function-symbol_>"`(`"<_floating-point-number_>"  "<_term_>"`)`" The function symbols are defined as needed. 
2. Special expressions are _not_ valid expressions in _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_, they are _only_ used for defining special units.

### 3.2 Arbitrary Units

**§24 arbitrary units** {#para-24}

1. Arbitrary or procedure defined units are units whose meaning entirely depends on the measurement procedure (assay). These units have no general meaning in relation with any other unit in the SI. Therefore those arbitrary semantic entities are called _arbitrary units_, as opposed to _proper units_. The set of arbitrary units is denoted _A_, where _A_ ∩ _U_ = {}. 
2. An arbitrary unit has no further definition in the semantic framework of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ 
3. Arbitrary units are not "of any specific dimension" and are not "commensurable with" any other unit.

Until version 1.6 _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ has dealt with arbitrary units as dimensionless, but as an effect the semantics of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ made all arbitrary units commensurable. Since version 1.7 of _The Unified Code for Units of Measure_ it is no longer possible to convert or compare arbitrary units with any other arbitrary unit.

**§25 operations on arbitrary units** {#para-25}

1. Any term involving arbitrary units, is itself an arbitrary unit and is not comparable with any other arbitrary unit or term.

**§26 definition of arbitrary units** {#para-26}

1. Arbitrary units are marked in the definition tables for unit atoms by a bullet ('•') in the column titled "value" and a bullet in the column titled "definition".
